# TODO consider modelling groundwater as storage: es, groundwater can indeed be modeled as storage.
# Groundwater storage refers to the volume of water stored in an aquifer, which can be influenced
# by factors such as recharge (inflow) and discharge (outflow) rates.
#This concept is crucial for understanding and managing water resources,
# especially in regions dependent on groundwater for agriculture, drinking water, and industry.

# Groundwater models often use specific storage (SS) values to predict how groundwater levels will respond
# to various factors like pumping, recharge, and climate change2. These models help in making informed decisions
# about water management and sustainability.
